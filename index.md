# Stardew Access

An accessibility mod for Stardew Valley with screen reader and keyboard only support. Currently only for windows.
Before we talk about the mod, let's see what actually is Stardew Valley.

## What is Stardew Valley?

Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!

## What can the mod do?

Well currently the mod has a keybind that narrates health and stamina/energy and a keybind that narrates the current tile position of the player. The mod also reads all the various dialogues including the ones which have a choice in them. Most of the menus are accessible with some of them having a shortcut keybind. Read tile feature detects and narrates the objects, crops and stuff on the tile the player is looking at, which is usually the tile adjacent to the player's position according to the direction the player is facing. And the Snap Mouse feature snaps the mouse cursor to the tile that read til feature uses. With the latest update, footstep sounds now stop when the player is colliding. These are all the features provided currently but here are the future features, tile-by-tile movement will be added for better navigation, making the rest of the menus accessible, sound cues for nearby objects and NPCs and hopefully a path finder thing.
