# Stardew Access

An accessibility mod for Stardew Valley with screen reader and keyboard only support. Currently only for windows and linux.
Before we talk about the mod, let's see what actually is Stardew Valley.

## What is Stardew Valley?

Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!

## What can the mod do?

Well, the game is 80-90% accessible at the moment, all the basic menus are accessible and some of the late game menus are not accessible but will be in the next few updates. There are keybinds that tell us the player's health, stamina, money, etc. A feature called `Read Tile` which tells us the name of the object on the tile, if the object is crop then it will also tell us if the crop is harvestable. There's also a feature which `Radar` which plays a sound at objects nearby, since stardew valley does not support stereo sound, it is not that helpful in locating objects but this combined with a `Path Finding` feature in the [Accessible Tiles] (https://github.com/GrumpyCrouton/SDV-AccessibleTiles) will make locating of objects and NPCs like forages easier. There are also keybinds and commands specific to some menus so do check out the lists for both in [Mod Details](/mod-details) page.
