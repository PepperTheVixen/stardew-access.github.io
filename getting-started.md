## An audio and video demo of a screen reader user playing and explaining how things work
 [Here's a link of one of the beta testers playing the game if you want to listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00L504aVXRY)

## Creating a New Game
Before we get into how to create a game and character, we want to remind you that the accessibility mod is still in beta.  
There may be bugs so please report them and try not to get mad when sometimes things don't work.

With that disclaimer out of the way, let's start.  
Now that your game and mods are set up, the next thing you should do is... Yes you guessed. Play.

To do this, you can go in your steamapps folder,
click on the common folder,
then on the Stardew Valley folder.
Once you're there, press enter on the StardewModdingAPI.exe file.
That will open a console window and the game window.
Keep both of them open, you will need the console too.

Alt tab until you find the game window.
There, press W or s.  
If nothing shows up, press left square brace.
You should hear a sound once left square brace is pressed.  

Now try to use A and D.  
Your screenreader should say: New Button. Load Button.  
If this is your first character, you will want to press left square brace on new.

## Creating your first character
Great job so far, let's get your first character started.  
In this menu, you navigate using the arrows.  
When you press right arrow, it will ask you to write your farmer's name. Press left square brace then write it.  
You figured out the name? Good, follow the same steps to write the farm name by pressing right arrow again.  
The next thing you should write is favorite thing. Here write whatever comes to your mind.

The next button that you will see is skip intro.  
It's up to you if you want to go through it. Basically it's your character's introduction to the farm.  
If you want to skip it just press left square brace on it.  
If you want to listen to the tutorial, don't press it and continue.

And now what you've been waiting for, the okay button.  
Press it!  
If you decided to go forward with the intro, all you have to do is to wait and listen.  
When the dialogue is read by your screenreader of choice, press left square brace to move forward.  
Once the intro is done, you will find yourself inside your farmhouse.

Nicely done, you just created your first Stardew Valley character.  

## Useful keys 
Before you start playing, here are the keys that you will use:  
W to move north.  
S to move south.  
D to move east.  
A to move west.  
W, S, D and A are also the keys you will use when you navigate through your inventory, crafting skills or the shop menus and so on.  
Q narrates the time of day and the season.  
E opens the inventory, you can get out of the menu by pressing e again or escape.  
R narrates your money.  
X is used to open doors, chests, menus in shops or when you complete quests that ask you to bring someone something. This  is the key you need for example when you want to open the door to your farmhouse to get back inside.  
C is used when you use your tools. So when you want to use your fishing pole, you select it from your hotbar and press c. The same rule applies to the other tools or things that can be used from your inventory.  
F opens your journal menu. Here you will be able to see your quests.  
H is used to check your health and stamina.  
J is an alternate way to click.  
K is a key that you will need a lot, because it is the one that reads your coordinates.  
Numbers 1 through 9 and 0, minus and equal are your hotbar keys. If you press 4 you select your axe for example and by pressing c you use it on whatever's in front of you.  
Left square brace [ is the key that becomes left click. You use it to accept quests, navigate through dialogues, buy things from shops, organise your inventory and much more. To give you an example on how it works in the inventory, for example, let's say that on the right you have your water can, number 4 and to the left you have an axe, number 3. But you want the axe to be on the right, and the can on the left.  
So you press left click on the axe, and you will hear a sound. you press d to move to the right where your can is. By pressing left click again you dropped the axe there and picked up the can.  
Now you press a to go to the left and drop the water can.

## Menu navigation
Navigating menus is done in different ways which will be covered in other sections of this guide, but right now I want to focus on the inventory menu.  
You open it with e, but there's more to your inventory than the row of tools and objects that you will collect during your playtime.  
To the right of your tools you will find the trashcan.  
If you want to throw away something to make more space, all you have to do is to select the object with left click, then to go to the trash and press the same key again.  
You will hear a sound and your object is gone.

Besides that, if you press w once focused on your inventory, you will find some more tabs.  
They are: inventory, skills, social, map, crafting, collections, options and exit game.

In the skills inventory you will see your skills.  
At first there will be nothing, you have to forage, fish, farm and so on for text to appear.  
The social menu isn't accessible yet. It's a work in progress.  
The map can't tell you what's going on, but it can tell you what places are in the game and when they're open, so it's worth a look.  
The crafting menu is accessible. To select it, use the left brace, and press s to see what recipes you have unlocked.  
Your screenreader will tell you what you can craft and what materials you need.  
So if for a chest you need 50 pieces of wood and you have the wood all you have to do to craft it is to press left brace.  
If you have enough space in your inventory, the crafted chest will appear.
In the collections menu you will see what things have been shipped and in what quantities.  
The options menu isn't accessible yet.  
And the exit game button is self explanatory. You can press on it and use s to see the options you have to quit.

## Movement
Movement in Stardew Valley is done, how I already mentioned using A, S, W and D.  
If you want to move tile by tile, you press s and release your key. You won't hear footsteps all the time, that's still being worked on, but by checking your coordinates you will see that you moved.  
If you didn't that means that there's something blocking your path.  
We recommend using your tools one by one to try to get rid of the obstacle.  
Usually using your hoe or scythe works, so try those first.  
If you want to move more than one tile, hold down the key and you will hear your character moving.

## the first days. Getting Started
Now that you're in the game, you can start being a farmer.  
To do this, you have to plant and to clean your farmland.

But being your first day, you can explore a little the farm, if you want.  
To do this first you check your coords with k and move to the left, because most likely you are next to your bed.  
What you're looking for is the exit to the farmhouse, which is around the coordinates 3 11.  
Once you find that press s and you will be out of the farmhouse.  
Your coordinates changed probably to 64 15 or 64 18.  
Note them down so you don't get lost.

What you do now is up to you, you can try to clean south of your farm. So press s twice and listen to what your screenreader says.  
If it says grass, press 5 and c a few times. then 2 and c to till your soil.  
You should have now a patch of soil.  
Using the tools is easy. an axe cuts trees, pickaxe stones, a water can waters seeds and so on.

If you're done exploring and experimenting, go back to your farm, 64 15, and press x.  
You should hear a door sound.  
You are back in your farmhouse.  
Now go east until you find your bed.  
A dialog should pop-up asking you if you want to sleep.  
If you select yes, you will start the next day and the game will save. Going to sleep is the only way you save your current day so make sure that if you have to stop playing, you go to sleep.

## Cleaning your farm with your tools
Using tools should be easy to understand.
You have a farm and you need to clean it.  
The easiest way is to go south of your farm until your coordinates stop changing, around 64, 61.  
So starting from 64 18, start using your tools on each tile and keep moving south.  
Then once you cleared that, move to the left or to the right and move up to 63 15 or 65 15 and keep repeating the process until you have enough plots cleared and enough crafting materials.  
Remember to keep track of the time with q to be inside the house before midnight.  

## How to plant
This being a farming game, you will need to plant things.  
Luckily, that is pretty easy.  
In your house you should find a chest.  
Open it with x.  
You should have received some seeds.  
If you have some cleared and tilled soil, all you have to do is to get out of your farm,  
look for your seeds using numbers 1 through 9 and 0, minus and equal and once you found your seeds,
press c when your screenreader says soil and your seed will be planted.  
Don't forget to water it once it's planted and keep watering it daily.  
If you think that you may forget where your seed is, note down the coordinates somewhere.  
Repeat the process until you have no more seeds.  
You can plant one seed per tilled soil.
