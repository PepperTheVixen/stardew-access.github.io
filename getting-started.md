## Creating a New Game
Now that your game and mods are set up, the next thing you should do is... Yes you guessed. Play.

To do this, you can go in your steamapps folder,
click on the common folder,
then on the Stardew Valley folder.
Once you're there, press enter on the StardewModdingAPI.exe file.
That will open a console window and the game window.
Keep both of them open, you will need the console too.

Alt tab until you find the game window.
There, press W or s.  
If nothing shows up, press left square brace.
You should hear a sound once left square brace is pressed.  

Now try to use A and D.  
Your screenreader should say: New Button. Load Button.  
If this is your first character, you will want to press left square brace on new.

## Creating your first character
Great job so far, let's get your first character started.  
In this menu, you navigate using the arrows.  
When you press right arrow, it will ask you to write your farmer's name. Press left square brace and write it.  
You figured out the name? Good, follow the same steps to write the farm name by pressing right arrow again.  
The next thing you should write is favorite thing. Here write whatever comes to your mind.

The next button that you will see is skip intro.  
It's up to you if you want to go through it. Basically it's your character's introduction to the farm.  
If you want to skip it just press left square brace on it.  
If you want to listen to the tutorial, don't press it and continue.

And now what you've been waiting for, the okay button.  
Press it!  
If you decided to go forward with the intro, all you have to do is to wait and listen.  
When the dialogue is read by your screenreader of choice, press left square brace to move forward.  
Once the intro is done, you will find yourself inside your farmhouse.

Nicely done, you just created your first Stardew Valley character.
