## SMAPI setup

1. Before installing SMAPI, run the game at least once.
2. Download the [latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
3. Extract the .zip file somewhere. (Your downloads folder is fine.)
4. For Windows users, double-click `install on Windows.bat`, and follow the on-screen instructions. At this point, you can run the `StardewModdingAPI.exe` which will be generated in your game folder. If you want the game clients to lauch the game through this file automatically and to enable features like tracking and awards, go to [configuring the game client](#configuring-the-game-client)
5. For Linux users, run the `install on Linux.sh` file, and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - if you've installed steam through flatpak, follow [this](#TODO-add-link-here) guide.
   - if the installer asks for game folder path, follow [this](#TODO-add-link-here) guide.

### Configuring the game client

*(Skip if you are on linux, this process is not required for linux users.)*

Configuring the game client is not a necessary step, only do this if you want the tracking and awards from the client. 

*Note: This guide will be updated for screen reader users soon.*

4. Paste it into the `Mods` folder in your game folder.
